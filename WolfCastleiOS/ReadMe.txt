WahooDemoV2.

This is a new, more modern version of our demo application initally built with iOS 7/8. It is limited in its function and it mostly a demo for the new WFDiscoveryManager introduced in API v3.3.

This demo is not a replacement for the original demo and it is recomended that you review the other Wahoo demo to get detail information on using our API. We will continue to work on this demo, turning it into a fully featured demo application.
